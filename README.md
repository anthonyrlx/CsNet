# Csnet

Csnet is a simple application that implements the Dijkstra algorithm to find the best path between points in a graph

Csnet uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Evented I/O for the backend
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) - Fast node.js network app framework
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
* [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
* [GCP App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) - Web framework and cloud computing platform for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers

Database is hosted on [Mlab](https://mlab.com/).

Current version of the project can be seen running in https://csnet-239015.appspot.com/


## Requirements
What you're going to need:
- NodeJs
- Npm or yarn

## Installing the dependencies and running development server:
```
$ cd CsNet
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
By default, the server will run on port 9000, so change this within the backend/index.js if necessary
