#Csnet

Csnet is a simple application that implements the Dijkstra algorithm to find the best path between points in a graph

Csnet uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/) - fast node.js network app framework
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js

Database is hosted on [Mlab](https://mlab.com/).


##Requirements
What you're going to need:
- NodeJs
- Npm or yarn

## Installing the dependencies and running development server:
```
$ cd CsNet/backend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
By default, the server will run on port 9000, so change this within the backend/index.js if necessary
